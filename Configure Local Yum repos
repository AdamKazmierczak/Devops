The Nautilus production support team and security team had a meeting last month in which they decided to use local yum repositories for maintaing packages needed for their servers. For now they have decided to configure a local yum repo on Nautilus Backup Server. This is one of the pending items from last month, so please configure a local yum repository on Nautilus Backup Server as per details given below.
a. We have some packages already present at location /packages/downloaded_rpms/ on Nautilus Backup Server.
b. Create a yum repo named local_yum and make sure to set Repository ID to local_yum. Configure it to use package's location /packages/downloaded_rpms/.
c. Install package vim-enhanced from this newly created repo.

vi /etc/yum.repos.d/localrepo.repo

[localrepo]
name=yum_local
baseurl=file:///packages/downloaded_rpms/
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1

createrepo -v /var/ftp/pub/localrepo/

yum install samba -y
