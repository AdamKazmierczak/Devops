We have a backup management application UI hosted on Nautilus's backup server in Stratos DC. That backup management application code is deployed under Apache on the backup 
server itself, and Nginx is running as a reverse proxy on the same server. Apache and Nginx ports are 6100 and 8094, respectively. 
We have iptables firewall installed on this server. Make the appropriate changes to fulfill the requirements mentioned below:
We want to open all incoming connections to Nginx's port and block all incoming connections to Apache's port. Also make sure rules are permanent.

sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m  tcp --dport 6440 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -L
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m  tcp --dport 8094 -j DROP


iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8092 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3000 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j REJECT


sudo iptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/iptables
service iptables restart
sudo iptables -L

iptables-save | sudo tee /etc/sysconfig/iptables
service iptables restart
