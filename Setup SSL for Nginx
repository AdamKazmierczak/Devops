The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries needs to deploy a new application on App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter. 
They have some pre-requites to get ready that server for application deployment. Prepare the server as per requirements shared below:
Install and configure nginx on App Server 1.
On App Server 1 there is a self signed SSL certificate and key present at location /tmp/nautilus.crt and /tmp/nautilus.key. Move them to some appropriate location and deploy the same in Nginx.
Create an index.html file with content Welcome! under Nginx document root.
For final testing try to access the App Server 1 link (either hostname or IP) from jump host using curl command. For example curl -Ik https://<app-server-ip>/.


add nginx reposity

sudo yum install epel-release -y

sudo yum install nginx -y

install nginx
create home/banner/data/index.html [light text welcome!]
set permissions for banner at home level and modify ownership
move certificate and key to /etc/nginx/ssl
install firewalld . open ports 80 and 443 . enable https service.restart firewalld
Edit server section of nginx.conf server - put IP add line listen 443 ssl …comment out the line root . under location add line -> root /home/banner/data;
7.restart nginx
Everything should be ok. else based on response from curl -Ik https://IP 3 …check and fix for relevant messages on /var/log/nginx/error.log
