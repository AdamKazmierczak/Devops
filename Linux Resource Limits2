On our Storage server in Stratos Datacenter we are having some issues where nfsuser user is holding hundred of processes, which is degrading the performance of the server.
Therefore, we have a requirement to limit its maximum processes. 
Please set its maximum process limits as below:




vi /etc/security/limits.conf

nfsuser soft nproc 76
nfsuser hard nproc 95

cat /etc/security/limits.conf | grep nproc | grep -v ^#
